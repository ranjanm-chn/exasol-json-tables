# Query Surface

This page is the detailed reference for the JSON-friendly SQL surface that Exasol JSON Tables installs on top of the raw source tables.

## What The Wrapper Surface Is

The maintained user-facing query surface is a wrapper package consisting of:

- public root/document views in a wrapper schema, for example `JSON_VIEW`
- a helper schema, for example `JSON_VIEW_INTERNAL`
- a scoped SQL preprocessor that only activates JSON syntax on those wrapper schemas

This means users query the wrapper views, not the raw helper tables produced by ingestion.

## Before You Query

Make sure the wrapper package has been installed, then activate the preprocessor in the SQL session where you want to use the JSON-aware syntax:

```sql
ALTER SESSION SET SQL_PREPROCESSOR_SCRIPT = JVS_WRAP_PP.JSON_WRAPPER_PREPROCESSOR;
```

Without that activation, the wrapper views still exist, but the extra JSON syntax sugar such as dotted paths and bracket access will not be rewritten.

If you query wrapper views from Python via PyExasol, treat `execute()` plus `fetchall()` as the primary interface for wrapper-syntax queries. PyExasol implements `export_to_pandas()` through `EXPORT ... INTO CSV`. On the current stack, simple root-wrapper queries can work when the preprocessor is active, but iterator-heavy wrapper syntax is still unreliable there and often degrades into an opaque `EmptyDataError` / `ExaExportError` chain. For notebook work, execute the wrapper query directly and build the DataFrame yourself:

```python
stmt = con.execute('SELECT "meta.info.note" FROM "JSON_VIEW"."SAMPLE" ORDER BY "_id"')
columns = list(stmt.columns())
rows = stmt.fetchall()
```

If you want `export_to_pandas()`, first publish an ordinary view or table with explicit casts and SQL-safe aliases, then export that durable object. See [python-dataframes.md](python-dataframes.md).

## Identifier Discipline

There are two different naming concerns on the wrapper surface:

- wrapper expressions and JSON property references
- durable SQL-facing column aliases for published views or export tables

Keep wrapper expressions quoted:

```sql
SELECT
  "child.value",
  "meta.info.note",
  "tags[LAST]"
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE;
```

But when you publish a durable view or table for downstream SQL, prefer uppercase SQL-safe aliases:

```sql
CREATE VIEW ANALYTICS.SAMPLE_EXPORT AS
SELECT
  CAST("id" AS VARCHAR(20)) AS DOC_ID,
  CAST("meta.info.note" AS VARCHAR(200)) AS DEEP_NOTE,
  CAST("tags[LAST]" AS VARCHAR(50)) AS LAST_TAG
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE;
```

That keeps downstream queries simple:

```sql
SELECT DOC_ID, DEEP_NOTE
FROM ANALYTICS.SAMPLE_EXPORT
ORDER BY DOC_ID;
```

If you instead publish lowercase quoted aliases such as `"doc_id"`, later SQL must keep quoting them.

Also treat names such as `source`, `schema`, `value`, and `type` as risky durable aliases. They may work when quoted, but a safer default is a SQL-friendly alias such as `SOURCE_SITE`, `VALUE_TEXT`, or `EVENT_TYPE`.

For a fuller set of conventions, see [identifier-conventions.md](identifier-conventions.md).

## Supported Surface

### Helper Functions

- `JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(expr)`
- `JSON_TYPEOF(expr)`
- `JSON_AS_VARCHAR(expr)`
- `JSON_AS_DECIMAL(expr)`
- `JSON_AS_BOOLEAN(expr)`

### Final-Output Function

- `TO_JSON(*)`
- `TO_JSON(col1, col2, ...)`

### Syntax Sugar

- dotted paths such as `"child.value"` or `"meta.info.note"`
- bracket access such as `"tags[0]"`, `"tags[FIRST]"`, `"tags[LAST]"`, `"tags[SIZE]"`, `"tags[id]"`, `"tags[?]"`, or prepared-statement-safe `"tags[PARAM]"`
- mixed deep access such as `"meta.items[LAST].value"`
- array rowset syntax such as `JOIN item IN s."items"` and `JOIN VALUE tag IN s."tags"`
- iterator-row path and bracket access such as `item."nested.note"` and `entry."extras[LAST]"`

`[PARAM]` still requires a client that actually sends prepared parameters. It is safe for prepared-statement-capable clients, but plain Python string execution with `execute("...")` does not magically turn it into a bound parameter.

## Core Semantics

### Final JSON Output With `TO_JSON`

`TO_JSON` is the primary final outlet when you want JSON back out of a query.

The examples below use the uppercase fixture views such as `JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE`. Real installed wrapper roots often keep the ingested table name, which may be lowercase. In that case, quote the public view exactly, for example:

```sql
SELECT TO_JSON(*) AS doc_json
FROM "EJT_CUSTOMER_EVENTS_VIEW"."customer_events";
```

On wrapped roots, it serializes the row recursively:

```sql
SELECT TO_JSON(*) AS doc_json
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "_id";
```

For selected top-level properties, keep the same root and name them explicitly:

```sql
SELECT TO_JSON("id", "meta", "items") AS doc_json
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "_id";
```

For ordinary tables or ordinary views, `TO_JSON` is also available, but it is a flat row serializer rather than a recursive wrapper export:

```sql
SELECT TO_JSON(*) AS row_json
FROM ANALYTICS_ROWS
ORDER BY "id";
```

Important boundaries:

- on wrapped roots, `TO_JSON(*)` recursively serializes the full document row
- on wrapped roots, `TO_JSON("field1", "field2")` recursively serializes only the selected top-level branches
- in joined wrapper queries, use qualified top-level properties such as `TO_JSON(s."id", s."meta")`; joined `TO_JSON(*)` is not supported
- on ordinary tables and ordinary views, `TO_JSON(*)` and `TO_JSON(alias.*)` are flat serializers
- on contract-encoded source-family tables, `TO_JSON(*)` is intentionally rejected; use the wrapper root instead
- in joined ordinary-table queries, use `TO_JSON(alias.*)` or qualified columns such as `TO_JSON(s."id", s."name")`
- nested paths such as `TO_JSON("meta.info.note")`, bracket expressions such as `TO_JSON("tags[SIZE]")`, and derived-table sources are not supported yet

### Missing vs Explicit `null`

Use `JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(...)` when you care about the difference between:

- a property that was present and explicitly `null`
- a property that was missing from the original JSON

Example:

```sql
SELECT
  "id",
  CASE WHEN JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL("note") THEN '1' ELSE '0' END AS explicit_null,
  CASE WHEN "note" IS NULL AND NOT JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL("note") THEN '1' ELSE '0' END AS missing
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "id";
```

### Variant Values

Use `JSON_TYPEOF(...)` and `JSON_AS_*` for JSON-aware variant semantics:

```sql
SELECT
  "id",
  JSON_TYPEOF("value") AS value_type,
  JSON_AS_VARCHAR("value") AS value_text,
  JSON_AS_DECIMAL("value") AS value_decimal
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "id";
```

When a variant contains a non-scalar branch:

- if `JSON_TYPEOF(expr) = 'OBJECT'`, traverse it with normal dotted paths such as `expr."note"` or `"flex.note"`
- if `JSON_TYPEOF(expr) = 'ARRAY'`, use bracket access or rowset expansion such as `"flex[LAST].value"` or `JOIN item IN row."flex"`
- `JSON_AS_VARCHAR(...)`, `JSON_AS_DECIMAL(...)`, and `JSON_AS_BOOLEAN(...)` are scalar extractors; object and array branches return `NULL` from those helpers until you navigate to a scalar child
- use these helpers on variant-style fields such as `"value"` or `"flex"`, where the per-row JSON type can vary
- do not use `JSON_TYPEOF(...)` as the primary inspection tool for structural wrapper branches whose visible columns are fixed object/array markers such as `child|object` or `tags|array`; traverse those branches, expand them, or serialize them with `TO_JSON(...)` instead

Example:

```sql
SELECT
  "doc_id",
  JSON_TYPEOF("flex") AS flex_type,
  "flex.note" AS flex_object_note,
  "flex[LAST].value" AS flex_array_last_value,
  JSON_AS_VARCHAR("flex") AS flex_scalar_text
FROM JSON_VIEW.DOCS
ORDER BY "doc_id";
```

Important: built-in `TYPEOF(...)` and plain SQL `CAST(...)` on wrapper views reflect the projected SQL type of the view column, not the original per-row JSON type contract.

### Nested Paths

```sql
SELECT
  "id",
  "child.value",
  "meta.info.note"
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "id";
```

### Array Access

```sql
SELECT
  "id",
  "tags[FIRST]",
  "tags[LAST]",
  "tags[SIZE]",
  "items[LAST].value",
  "tags[id]" AS tag_selected_by_id
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE
ORDER BY "id";
```

Dynamic bracket selectors support:

- numeric literals
- `FIRST`
- `LAST`
- `SIZE`
- `?`
- direct field names on the current row, such as `"tags[id]"` or `item."nested.items[pick].value"`

Arbitrary SQL expressions such as `"tags[id + 1]"` are intentionally rejected.

### Array Expansion Into Rows

When arrays should behave like rowsets, use `JOIN ... IN ...`:

```sql
SELECT
  s."id",
  item._index,
  item.value,
  item.label
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
JOIN item IN s."items"
ORDER BY s."id", item._index;
```

If you want the scalar value directly from a scalar array, use a `VALUE` iterator:

```sql
SELECT
  s."id",
  tag._index,
  tag
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
JOIN VALUE tag IN s."tags"
ORDER BY s."id", tag._index;
```

## Iterator-Row Semantics

Object-array iterator rows can use JSON helpers too:

```sql
SELECT
  s."id",
  item._index,
  JSON_TYPEOF(item."value") AS item_value_type,
  JSON_AS_VARCHAR(item."value") AS item_value_text,
  JSON_AS_DECIMAL(item."amount") AS item_amount_decimal,
  JSON_AS_BOOLEAN(item."enabled") AS item_enabled_boolean,
  item."nested.note" AS nested_note,
  item."nested.items[LAST].value" AS nested_last_item,
  CASE WHEN JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(item."optional") THEN '1' ELSE '0' END AS item_optional_explicit_null
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
JOIN item IN s."items"
ORDER BY s."id", item._index;
```

Current boundary:

- object-array iterator rows support JSON helpers, path traversal, and bracket traversal
- scalar `VALUE` iterators support plain SQL on the scalar value, but JSON helper/path syntax is intentionally not supported on them

## Modeling-Friendly SQL

The wrapper surface is meant to work in normal modeling shapes, not just direct ad hoc queries.

### CTEs

```sql
WITH item_features AS (
  SELECT
    CAST(s."id" AS VARCHAR(10)) AS doc_id,
    CAST(item._index AS VARCHAR(10)) AS item_index,
    COALESCE(JSON_TYPEOF(item."value"), 'MISSING') AS item_value_type,
    COALESCE(JSON_AS_VARCHAR(item."nested.items[LAST].value"), 'NULL') AS nested_last_value,
    CASE WHEN JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(s."note") THEN '1' ELSE '0' END AS root_note_explicit_null
  FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
  JOIN item IN s."items"
)
SELECT *
FROM item_features
ORDER BY doc_id, item_index;
```

### Persisted Modeling Objects

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW JVS_ANALYTICS.ITEM_MODEL AS
SELECT
  CAST(s."id" AS VARCHAR(10)) AS doc_id,
  CAST(item._index AS VARCHAR(10)) AS item_index,
  JSON_TYPEOF(item."value") AS item_value_type,
  item."nested.items[LAST].value" AS nested_last_value
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
JOIN item IN s."items";
```

### Joined Queries

In joined queries, qualify root-document helper arguments with the root alias:

```sql
JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(s."note")
JSON_TYPEOF(s."value")
```

Do the same for wrapper-root `TO_JSON(...)` subset exports:

```sql
SELECT TO_JSON(s."id", s."meta")
FROM JSON_VIEW.SAMPLE s
JOIN JVS_DIM.DOC_FLAGS f
  ON f.DOC_ID = s."id";
```

## Known Boundaries

- The preprocessor is session-local. Activate it in the SQL session where you want wrapper syntax.
- PyExasol `export_to_pandas()` runs `EXPORT ... INTO CSV` under the hood. Simple root-wrapper queries may work when the preprocessor is active, but wrapper syntax that depends on iterator rewrites is still unreliable there. Use `execute()` plus `fetchall()` for exploratory wrapper queries, or export a published ordinary view/table instead.
- In joined queries, qualify root-document helper arguments with the root alias, for example `JSON_IS_EXPLICIT_NULL(s."note")`.
- `TO_JSON(*)` is the primary final-output surface on wrapped roots, but joined wrapper queries must use qualified top-level subsets such as `TO_JSON(s."id", s."meta")`.
- On ordinary tables and ordinary views, `TO_JSON` is a flat row serializer and joined queries should use `TO_JSON(alias.*)` or qualified columns.
- Path/helper syntax does not start from derived-table roots yet. Move the JSON expression into the inner `SELECT` or query the wrapper view directly.
- `VALUE` iterators support plain SQL on the scalar value, but JSON helper/path syntax is intentionally not supported on them.
- `method` is an unsafe iterator alias. `JOIN VALUE method IN s."tags"` may parse, but later references such as `SELECT method` or `WHERE method = 'x'` are rewritten into a broken `METHOD_` token. Use aliases such as `tag`, `entry`, or `raw_method` instead.
- Use `JSON_TYPEOF(...)` and `JSON_AS_*` for JSON-aware variant semantics. Built-in `TYPEOF(...)` and plain `CAST(...)` reflect wrapper view SQL types, not the original per-row JSON type contract.
